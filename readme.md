### _Free and Open-Source Multiple Choice Exam Reader_

## Background

Commercially available OMR (optical mark recognition) exam sheets, scanners, and
processing software can cost educators and educational institutions thousands of
dollars per year. In response to this, OpenMCR has been developed as a free and
easy-to-use alternative. The tool includes a multiple choice exam sheet and
works with any scanner and printer.

This software and the
corresponding multiple choice sheet were developed as an independent study
project by Ian Sanders, a mechanical engineering student at the University of
South Florida, under the direction of Dr. Autar Kaw.

For a detailed discussion of the algorithm and features in use, please
[read the report](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr-report/releases/tag/1.0.0)
as submitted for the original independent study course.

## Installation Instructions

Currently, installers are only provided for Windows. For other operating
systems, see [Running From Source](#running-from-source).

### Windows Installation

To install the utility, simply download the latest `.exe` file from from the
[releases](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr/releases) page and
install it. After installation, check your Start menu for a shortcut.

### Running Without Install

For users who cannot or do not want to install the software on their machine,
ZIP file packages are also available for each [release](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr/releases). Download the file,
extract it anywhere on your machine, and run the `main.exe` file. This method
does not require administrator priveleges.

### Running From Source

If you wish to customize the software or you need to run it on a non-Windows
device, you can run the Python program directly from the source files. This
requires Python to be installed on your machine. Download
the latest `Source code (zip)` file from [releases](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr/releases).
Extract the file and open a terminal / command prompt in the extracted directory.
Run the command `python code/main.py`.

_Note_: This software has not been tested on other operating systems and support
is not guarunteed. If you find a bug, please file an [issue](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr/issues).
